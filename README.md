# Dumb(ish) prototype builder thing
Get prototypes out like there's no tomorrow. Using Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch and the like was fun while it lasted. Let's face it, they don't work any more. Prototype web apps on the web, for the web.

## List of tools
- âœ… React (no fancy stuff)
- âœ… SASS support
- âœ… LESS support
- âœ… PostCSS
- âœ… [Flexboxgrid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid) + [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
- âœ… Webpack:
    - âœ… Autoprefixer
    - âœ… Babel.js
    - âœ… Watch / reload (no fancy stuff)
    - âœ… ESLint
    - Make that prototype already ðŸ™Œ! 

## Setup
```bash
npm i
```

## Run
```bash
npm run proto
```

## Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

*Webpack lints automatically on save. To disable it, comment out the `preLoaders` part in `config/webpack.js`.*


## Misc
ðŸ”ž Built using node `v5.5.0`, but will likely run on any version (no funny stuff going on, promise ðŸ––).

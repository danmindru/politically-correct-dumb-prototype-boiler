# Dumb(ish) prototype builder thing
Get prototypes out like there's no tomorrow.

## List of tools
- âœ… React (no fancy stuff)
- âœ… SASS support
- âœ… LESS support
- âœ… PostCSS
- âœ… [Flexboxgrid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid) + [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
- âœ… Webpack:
    - âœ… Autoprefixer
    - âœ… Babel.js
    - âœ… Watch / reload (no fancy stuff)
    - âœ… ESLint
    - Make that prototype already ðŸ™Œ! 

## Run
```bash
npm run proto
```

## Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

*Webpack lints automatically on save. To disable it, comment out the `preLoaders` part in `config/webpack.js`.*


## Misc
ðŸ”ž Built using node `v5.5.0`, but will likely run on any version (no funny stuff going on, promise ðŸ––).
